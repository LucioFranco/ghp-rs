# ghp-rs
Easily import a folder to your gh-pages branch!

## Why?
I wrote this tool to help people who want to host documentation or anything on a `gh-pages` branch. This was heavily influenced by [ghp-import](https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import) and has a similar implementation.

## Install

### Via Cargo

```
cargo install ghp
```

### Via Binary
Coming Soon!

### Via Git

```
git clone https://github.com/LucioFranco/ghp-rs
cargo build
```

## Command Line Usage
```
ghp [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY

# Example

ghp build # move content of build folder to gh-pages branch

ghp --branch website build # will move the contents of the build folder to the website branch
```

## Programtic Usage
```
extern crate ghp;
use ghp::import_dir;

import_dir("build", "gh-pages").unwrap();
```
